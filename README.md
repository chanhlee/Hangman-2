# Hangman-2
Purpose: Java desktop application created to allow users to play game(s) of Hangman with a slight twist. 

Context: This was a project given in CSCI 1301 Introduction to Computing and Programming. It was coded in Java and can be run in any environment with JVM and jdk installed. The easiest way to run this program would be to import it as a project in IDEs such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. 

How to Play: Users choose from three available difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard. These will affect the amount of guesses the users have. Users will then be required to either guess the position and the letter at the position, or enter 'solve' at which point they can guess the whole word. Correct attempts will not consume turns while incorrect attempts will decrease the amount of turns they have.
